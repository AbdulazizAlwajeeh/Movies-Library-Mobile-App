main: Started the project as simple as possible.<br>
<br>state-management-version: Adding state management (Provider) for practice + scalability.<br>
<br>login-version: Decided to add a login functionality whereby the user can't CUD unless logged 
in.
<br>The backend was switched from Azure to AWS -1 month trial wasn't enough 🤷‍♂️-.
<br>JWT authentication is added on the backend to protect CUD endpoints 🔒.<br>
<br>The generated token is stored using Hive for a better UX -instead of logging every time 😤-.
